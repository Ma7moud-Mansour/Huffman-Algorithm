Machine learning was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side. The history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire to study cognitive processes. In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published The Organization of Behavior, introducing a theoretical neural structureaeoformed by nerve cell interactions. Hebb's neuron model laid groundwork for AI and machine learning algorithms using artificial neurons to communicate data. Logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch contributed early mathematical neural network models. Raytheon Company developed Cybertron, a machine with punched tape memory to analyze signals using reinforcement learning. It was trained by a human operator using a "goof" button to correct errors. Nilsson's Learning Machines in the 1960s covered pattern classification. By 1981, neural networks learned to recognize 40 characters from a terminal. Tom M. Mitchell later defined machine learning as algorithms that learn from experience.
