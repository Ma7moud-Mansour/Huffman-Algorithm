# Huffman-Algorithm
"This C++ project implements the Huffman Coding algorithm for lossless data compression. It builds a frequency table, constructs a Huffman tree, and performs encoding and decoding of text files. The algorithm reduces file size by using variable-length codes, making it efficient for compressing data without loss."
